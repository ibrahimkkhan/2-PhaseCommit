    "A **transaction** can be defined as a very small unit or task of a program which cannot be further divided in to smaller sub-tasks. A transaction must maintain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability − commonly known as **ACID** properties − in order to ensure accuracy, completeness, and data integrity. **Distributed transactions** are transactions in which two or more network hosts are involved. We will refer to these hosts as *COHORTS*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Two-phase commit protocol (2PC)** is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the *COHORTS* that participate in a distributed transaction on whether to **commit** or **abort** the transaction. The protocol is fault-tolerant i.e, the protocol achieves its goal even in cases of temporary system failure.\n"
